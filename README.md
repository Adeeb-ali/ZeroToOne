# Project->0 and 1
Computer science project that teaches how to build a computer from the ground up using only NAND gates. It covers hardware design, assembly language, and high-level programming, culminating in creating an operating system and running Tetris. Itâ€™s a hands-on journey from logic gates to full computation.
